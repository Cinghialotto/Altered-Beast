# Altered-Beast
Source code for Altered Beast on the C64
(c)Michael J Archer

Following the upload of Alien3 Source Code, this is the Altereb Beast code.

The actual source files here used an older version of PDS development System and this puts a binary data header at the begining.
So the files are not broken, it's just how the system stored the information.

Code started on 25th July 1989 last edit on 11th September 1989.
Prime example of pressured development time to produce a title.
